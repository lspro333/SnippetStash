 // Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log ("The number is " + i);
}

// From the example above, you can read:

// Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).

// Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

// Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.


 
 //loop
 // Creating an array of vegetables.
 var vegetables = ["Carrots", "Peas", "Lettuce", "Tomatoes"];

 // Looping through each item in the array and logging a message to the console.
 for (var i = 0; i < vegetables.length; i++) {
   console.log("I love " + vegetables[i]);
 }
